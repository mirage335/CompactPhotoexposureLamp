__Usage__
Nominally ~12V/25A power. Recommend pulse-width modulation or variable-current supply for controlling luminious flux.

Minimum voltage is 8.4V. Modulating voltage to adjust luminious flux is possible, but not recommended due to non-linear diode effects.

Intended working distance is ~6mm.

Strongly recommend purchasing the LEDs in bulk. Much lower prices.

BOM will not be accurate, as the array is formed by copy/pasting in the PCB layout tool. Multiply all quantities by the number of LED strings in the array, currently 105.

__Design__

*) Approximately 0.13mm shadows can be achieved at a working distance of 0.5mm with 492-1812-ND, which has a 15deg viewing angle. However, it is a through-hole component, approximately 8mm tall.
*) Approximately 0.26mm shadows can be achieved at the same working distance with 492-1534-2-ND, which has a 30deg viewing angle. As a surface mount component, it is only 1.5mm tall.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__

Intense ultraviolet light can be hazardous to vision, do not view.
